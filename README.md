# GenAI-Powered EDI Remittance Extraction & Reconciliation Bot (CashApp Automation)
🚀 Overview

The EDI Remittance Extraction Bot (CashApp Automation) is a GenAI-driven invoice reconciliation system built with FastAPI, Python, and Azure OpenAI.
It leverages Prompt Engineering, LLM-based field extraction, and API orchestration to process incoming EDI remittance advices and extract structured payment data for downstream RPA workflows.

The system acts as a smart layer between ERP (e.g., SAP) and remittance sources, automating the invoice posting and reconciliation cycle while ensuring data accuracy and compliance.

🧩 Tech Stack

Frameworks: FastAPI, Python

LLM Backend: Azure OpenAI (GPT-4 / GPT-4-Turbo)

Integration Layer: Orchestrator API (input source for EDI text)

Data Sources: EDI remittance files, vendor details, SAP reconciliation data

Architecture: Modular API-based pipeline

Storage: Local + database (for extracted structured data)

Deployment: Azure App Service / Docker container

Version Control: GitHub

✨ Key Features

🧠 LLM-Powered Field Extraction: Uses advanced prompt engineering to extract fields such as:

Invoice Numbers

Payment Amounts

Vendor Names and Contact Details

Bank Reference IDs

Payment Dates

🔄 Automated Reconciliation: Matches extracted fields with SAP records to validate transaction success.

⚙️ Orchestrator API Integration: Accepts EDI remittance data from external sources and returns structured JSON output.

📤 Downstream Integration: Shares cleaned and validated data with RPA bots for invoice posting in SAP.

🧩 Error Handling & Exception Routing: Detects incomplete or mismatched records and routes them for human review.

🧾 Explainable Extraction: Each extraction is traceable with reasoning and validation confidence.

📊 Monitoring Dashboard (optional): Track reconciliation status and extraction metrics.

🔐 Secure API Layer: Token-based authentication for all endpoints.

🧠 Scalable Architecture: Modular design for easy extension to other document types (e.g., AR/AP statements).

🧠 Current Capabilities

EDI ingestion via orchestrator APIs

AI-driven field extraction using GPT-4

Reconciliation logic integrated with SAP posting workflow

REST API endpoints for integration with RPA tools (UiPath, Automation Anywhere, etc.)

Logging and error tracking for failed reconciliations

🔮 Future Enhancements

🚢 Deployment on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS): Enable high-availability and multi-client processing.

🤖 Auto-Retraining on Failed Cases: Fine-tune prompt templates based on exception patterns.

📈 Analytics Dashboard: Reconciliation trend tracking and process KPIs.

🧾 Multi-Format Support: Extend to CSV, JSON, and structured PDF remittance formats.

🧑‍💼 Human-in-the-Loop Review Panel: Web interface for reviewing failed or low-confidence extractions.

💬 Notification System: Email/Teams alerts for reconciliation failures.

🔐 Enhanced Compliance Layer: Integrate with audit-ready logging and data retention policies.
